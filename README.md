# grades_mgt
This software aims to support college and high school teachers to record the grades of their students, get statistics on their progress individually or by group and have a good overview of the results of an exam.

This is early stage development so there is no installation documentation for now. The next development steps are:
* implement a prototype version (terminal based) to test the algorithms and functionalities
* implement a proper user interface (using Qt probably)
* implement security to ensure only the teacher can access the information
